# Sorting-Algorithms-Benchmarking-App
Java program which allows the user to choose array size, sorting algorithm, worst, best or average case complexity. 
Based on the input, program will display the time consumption of the selected sorting algorithm.

This project has two java files
1. BenchmarkingApp.java
2. SortingAlgorithms.java

BenchmarkingApp.java file contains the code to interact with the user. 
It displays the menus and take the input from user and based on the input appropriate method is called to perform the task.
